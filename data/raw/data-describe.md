 CRC Microbiome ML Dataset

 📊 About This Dataset

This dataset contains **processed gut microbiome data** from 60 samples for **Colorectal Cancer (CRC) detection** using machine learning. The data is derived from 16S rRNA gene sequencing and has been preprocessed using the DADA2 pipeline.

 1. `seqtab_nochim_export.xlsx` (1.4 MB)

- **ASV (Amplicon Sequence Variant) abundance table**
- Rows: Patient samples (60 samples)
- Columns: DNA sequences (ASVs) representing different bacterial species
- Values: Read counts (how many times each bacteria was detected)

 2. `taxa_species_export.xlsx` (511 KB)

- **Taxonomic classification table**
- Maps each ASV to its taxonomic classification
- Includes: Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species

 3. `metadata.csv` (2.8 KB)

- **Patient information**
- Columns:
  - `SampleID`: Unique sample identifier
  - `host_disease`: Disease classification code
  - `SampleName`: Sample name
  - `DiseaseStatus`: Colorectal cancer | Healthy | Adenomatous Polyps
  - `Sex`: Patient gender
  - `Age`: Patient age

 🎯 Usage

This dataset is ready for machine learning! Use it to:

1. Train classification models to predict CRC from gut microbiome composition
2. Identify bacterial genera associated with CRC
3. Compare microbial diversity between healthy and CRC patients
